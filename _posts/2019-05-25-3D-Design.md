### The Medium

As humans, we perceive the world around us in the form of 3 dimensions. The goal of 3D design is, simply put, to bring a vision to life. This vision can take any form, from minimalist and low-poly, to hard surface modelling, to detailed textures environments.

### First Steps

The software I’d recommend to use is [Blender3D](https://blender.org). Its free, open source, has good add-ons and a helpful community, so it’s great as a starting software. Once you’ve picked it up, learning to operate other 3D software is easy, due to common principles of the softwares. Blender also has a well spread out feature set, so it doesn’t have much fields which it’s not good in, unlike other 3D software.

I’d highly recommend the Blender beginner series’ by [Andrew Price(BlenderGuru)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYj6e-72RDs) and [CG Cookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUhWdGcOHPw), check both of them out, and follow whichever you follow through better. Their advanced tutorials are great too.

### Project Phase

Once you’ve done basics from the series, try creating something, no matter how basic, even if its something [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tY06WmWd0&feature=youtu.be).While the learning curve is steep at first, after the basics, it follows a staircase pattern of learning from tutorials, then making.

It is a more steady path to getting better than only practicing/only seeing tutorials. A daily dedication of ½ hour is better than a weekend commitment of 4 hours, because doing all that practice at once doesn’t help as much, and you have much more probability of carrying it out if its spending some time every day. Also, set time limits on projects, and follow them, no point in stretching a project too long, since perfection is overrated.

Watching tutorials is helpful for learning various workflows, which can be applied in many situations. Don’t simply follow the tutorial, make variations and experiment. This is crucial.

Getting critique is extremely useful, never underestimate the learning you can get from a critique.

### Art Theory

Spending some time on art theory videos can help in giving that important push which your renders would’ve lacked before. I’d recommend Andrew Price’s series on this, with [Understanding Composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8i7OKbWmRM) and [Understanding Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj1FK8n7WgY). Also, learn to use the compositor and other advanced features and post-processing effects.

### General Tips

This is just a list of some must-have knowledge:

- Check out [HDR Labs' sIBL Archive](www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html) for HDRIs, they satisfy most use cases for HDRIs. Old industrial hall is especially versatile.

* Learn to use the new universal material, the Principled BSDF, it is physically accurate, and also for color management, [Filmic Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9AT7H4GGrA), it helps you get great results.

- Tinker with RGB curves, math nodes, and the compositor.

* Use the new denoiser, micro displacement, and adaptive subdivision. These will save you a LOT of time.

- Install/enable essential addons such as node wrangler, import images as planes, BoolTool, Amaranth Toolset, Auto Render Tile Size, ANT Landscape, BLAM Blender Camera Calibration Toolkit. There are many more useful addons, so if you run into trouble doing some task, there’s a chance of it having an addon.

* When in doubt about some error/unexpected behavior, ask at the [Blender Stack Exchange forums](https://blender.stackexchange.com/).

- In many situations, you can implement workarounds to traditional methods such as simulations, due to them requiring a lot of computing resources. As you model, you will obtain the intuition required for this, as such work arounds can often reduce your render times from hours to minutes!

Also, keep on persevering, it’ll take time, but you’ll start making good stuff, don’t worry about that. Just don’t worry too much if you’re not improving drastically, just enjoy the journey.

### Inspiration

Many beginners lose motivation when doing 3D design, as they’re not making great stuff. For this reason, I’d recommend you to check out Deviantart, blenderartists and CGstreet, and take a screenshot of the renders which you like, and paste it in a central location, where that be a Google Doc or Evernote file. When you’re feeling a loss of determination, just open this file, to remember the motivation behind what you want to do.

Also, subscribe to the Sketchfab weekly digest, the models(by the community) featured in it for that are stunning, and you can view it from different angles in real-time, in your browser!

### Getting Into Competitive 3D

Competitive 3D refers to competitions where you are given a time limit and are expected to make a model in set time, at maximum 2.5 - 3 hours. For this, you need to decide on what will element impact your scene, and by impact spend time on it.

You need a clear vision, first of all, so make placeholder objects(cube, sphere, cylinder, etc) and setup a prototype scene first, so you know the requirements of the scene and then later replace them with detailed models you make and add necessary lighting.

Perhaps the critical point is lighting, it often takes less time than much of model, texturing, and the materials, but it may impact the scene the most. Good lighting brings out details through shadows, sets the “mood” of the scene and gives it good aesthetic feel.

While in a normal scenario, a scene is made around only 1 render, so the final product is what matters most, in competitions you can often be asked to provide, 2, 3, or even 4 views! This is also true for product design, so don’t skimp out on the initial detail on sides which may be visible at least. This can be alleviated by setting a prototype scene before hand, as mentioned above, with camera positions and all.
Also, don’t underestimate render times, and no need to set a sample rate too high, especially now that the denoiser is here, and never forget to save a scene, as blender still has a few bugs, and is a good practice in general.

The hierarchy of importance of stages are as follows:
