Design consists of designing everything from logos, posters, infographics, banners, UI/UX design, mockups for websites and apps, to animations and interactions.

There are several programs you can use for graphic design. Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are two of the most popular ones, so it is recommended that you use either one or both of these. You might also find Sketch (on Mac) and Affinity Designer useful.

### Step 1: Learn the tools

- [Introduction to Photoshop](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-photoshop-5/)
- [Introduction to Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/ai-basics-fundamentals.html)

Here are two great follow-along video courses:

- [Photoshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF_jSrBhdlg)

### Step 2: Practice

Good design comes with practice. It is okay to take inspiration from existing designs and recreate them when you’re learning. Don’t worry about being completely original – that will come later, once you are more comfortable the basics. When you learn a musical instrument, you learn how to play other people’s songs before composing your own. Same goes for design.

When you find a good design, try and recreate it. You can try modifying it and adding more elements to it, to make it more visually appealing. Watch tutorials if you want to learn how to make something specific, or if you are stuck. You will learn best by actually making and designing stuff. With practice, you will understand the principles of good design and be able to create your own. Remember, this process takes time! Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbC4gqZGPSY).

<i><b>Note:</b> While this is a good idea when you are just getting started, it is <b><u>NOT OKAY</u></b> to publish others' designs as your own or use them anywhere without permission from the creator. Recreate others' designs only for learning purposes - only to understand what good design is and what goes behind making one. Always credit the original source whenever copying or taking inspiration from a design. Remember, <b><u>plagiarism is unacceptable</u></b> and can lead to serious consequences.</i>

## Fonts and colours

Nobody wants to look at a yellow background with green Comic Sans or cursive text. Good fonts and colour schemes are key to an aesthetically pleasing design; they can make or break an otherwise good design. Here are some recommended resources to help you get those colours and fonts just right:

1. **Fonts and typography**
