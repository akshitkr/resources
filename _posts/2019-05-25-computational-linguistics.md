Linguistics problems come in many shapes and sizes. If you are new to linguistics, we would recommend looking at the problems presented as Fun Problems on the page of the [Panini Linguistics Olympiad](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/plo/resources.php). Once you have completed those, you can consider moving onto the problems of the olympiad itself (note that these are much more difficult). However, we will mostly be requiring competitors to solve computational linguistics problems, and hence, we suggest you try those out first. Examples of computational linguistics problems include:

1. [PLO Senior 2014, Problem 6 (Encoding Trees)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwYW5pbmlsaW5ndWlzdGljc29seW1waWFkfGd4OjVkNDViYjNkMjBjYjYwMTQ)
2. [PLO Senior 2015, Problem 3 (Mnemonic Major System)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwYW5pbmlsaW5ndWlzdGljc29seW1waWFkfGd4OjY1MjYwOTc2MWVjOGVkMw)
3. [PLO Senior 2017, Problem 2 (Circles and Dots)](https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/plo/Documents/QBSPLO2017.pdf)
4. [PLO Senior 2018, Problem 2 (Word Embeddings)](https://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/ltrc.iiit.ac.in/nlpmt/plo/Documents/QBSPLO2018.pdf)

We also recommend reading about and exploring other fields of linguistics explored in the past papers of PLO, including phonology, morphology, semantics and number systems. While problems can come in the Turing Test paper from these fields, they would be designed so that people without knowledge of terminology can solve them as well, and points will be given to everyone who solves the questions, irrespective of whether they use precise linguistic terminology or not. However, as this is often an intuition-based challenge, having a firmer grasp of fundamental linguistics concepts is often helpful in guiding some of your guesses and provides a better logic to understanding why something works the way it does.

Further challenges can be explored here. Note that some of these are problems from the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) itself, and while they are excellent practice for beginners trying to be better at solving problems, they are not as easy to solve as the problems mentioned earlier.

1. [Sample IOL Problems](http://www.ioling.org/problems/samples/) - Fun, but challenging
2. [NACLO Problems](http://nacloweb.org/) - Range from very easy to very difficult at times, do check out the problems and don’t get disheartened if you find them too difficult at times. Despite the name being “Computational Linguistics” Olympiad, not all problems are from computational linguistics. Used to select USA’s IOL team.
3. [UKLO Problems](http://www.uklo.org/problems) - Used to select UK’s IOL team, similar to NACLO and PLO, you will need to see which problems are computational linguistics problems.
4. [Actual IOL Problems](http://www.ioling.org/problems/) - These are very difficult, and are generally tackled at the end, and only after lots of practice is it possible to solve them. However, do not let their difficulty level put you off, and we would suggest looking at these problems and trying to solve them. Recommended computational linguistics problems include - Telepathy (2013), mRNA Sequencing (2010), Soundex (2015), EAN-13 (2011). However, if you get interested in linguistics competitions (we hope you do!) after participating in Turing Test, feel free to check out the amazing range of problems you will find here, and we recommend Transcendental Algebra (2003), Abui (2017) and Emoji/Indonesian (2017 Team Problem) to peep inside this fascinating world.
