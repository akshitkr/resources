## Adding a page

Pages are rendered from the `_posts` directory and are written in [markdown](https://markdownguide.com). To add a page, create a file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md` and add the following front-matter:

```
---
title: Your title
date: 20 May 2019  # Date when the page was last updated
permalink: /newpage  # What url you want the page to be shown at (/newpage will show the page at exun.co/resources/newpage)
layout: post
---
```

and you're ready to write!
